## Nice to Meet You

My name's Francesco Marrato. I am a Canadian roboticist with a MASc in Electrical and Computer engineering.

I am interested in the design of reliable, capable, and dynamic, autonomous field robots. I create for the embetterment of everyday people, to make intelligent robotics commonplace. 

This website serves as a showcase of past projects I've completed from my academic research, professional work, and personal interests.
