## Nice to Meet You

My names Francesco Marrato. I am a Canadian engineer with a MASc in Electrical and Computer engineering.

I am an experienced roboticist interested in the creation of reliable, capable, and dynamic, autonomous field robots. 

This website serves as a showcase of past projects I've completed from my academic research, professional work, and personal interests.
