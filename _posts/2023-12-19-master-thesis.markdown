# Spot Explores Simulated Disasters With Robotic Ears
<!-- Type of Project -->
<div align="center"> MASc Research </div>

### Overview
My master thesis, titled "*Sound Source Tracking as a Heuristic for Frontier Exploration in Search and Rescue using a Quadruped Mobile Robot*". A full systems integration project, including mapping, behavioral modelling, localization, perception, control, and hardware development. Designed around the Spot quadruped robot developed by Boston Dynamics.

Spot explored previously unmapped environments while tracking the sounds of human speech. The direction of the incoming sound was used to intelligently decide where to search next. Much like human search parties, this system used human voice as a compass, building a map of its environment as it searched for the target source.

The system was tested in ideal lab environments, semi-structured simulated urban disaster scenarios, and unstructured forest terrain. This research furthered Spot's operating envelope by incorporating autonomous frontier exploration with no prior environment knowledge.

I was fortunate enough to present my findings at [IROS 2023 Detroit](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/francesco-marrato_iros2023-activity-7114980573646917632-9t4Y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
